# This is a Shiny script for an interactive volcano plot based on the #
# statistic analysis results of Limma. The differentially expressed   #
# genes can be easily identify using a volcano plot. Here, genes      #
# upregulated or downregulated are highlighted by different colours   #
# interactive options are provided for significance cutoffs, so the   #
# user can find the genes of interested.  Besides, Font sizes and     #
# point sizes can also be changed for better visual experiences.      #
# Moreover, user can click on the points of interest or select        #
# interested data area to display more detailed point information.    #
# Finally, a table of all data information is provided in a seperate  #
# panel for easy data access. Genes can be easily sorted or searched. #
#                                                                     #
# Note: this warning message might be seen when the app is run:       #
# "Warning: Removed 45094 rows containing missing values              #
# (geom_text_repel)". This is because only upregulated and            #
# downregulated gene names are displayed for the plot. This does not  #  
# affect the functionality or accuracy of the plot.                   #
